- 5 - Inheritance
>Inheritance is a programming construct that software developers use to establish is-a relationships between categories. Inheritance enables us to derive more-specific categories from more-generic ones. The more-specific category is a kind of the more-generic category. For example, a checking account is a kind of account in which you can make deposits and withdrawals. Similarly, a truck is a kind of vehicle used for hauling large items.
Inheritance can descend through multiple levels, leading to ever-more-specific categories. As an example, Figure 1 shows car and truck inheriting from vehicle; station wagon inheriting from car; and garbage truck inheriting from truck. Arrows point from more-specific "child" categories (lower down) to less-specific "parent" categories (higher up).
Inheritance in JavaJeff Friesen
Figure 2. Hovercraft multiply inherits from land vehicle and water vehicle categories
This example illustrates single inheritance in which a child category inherits state and behaviors from one immediate parent category. In contrast, multiple inheritance enables a child category to inherit state and behaviors from two or more immediate parent categories. The hierarchy in Figure 2 illustrates multiple inheritance.
